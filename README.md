# Project-Overview
The Advanced UAC REsearch Organization is a project based club focused on designing, building, and testing a high speed autonomous airplane. The project emphasizes hands-on engineering, collaboration, and applied research in software, hardware, and avionics. This roadmap is iterative and tentative as we learn and research new technologies.

| Phase                                | Focus                  | Key Goals                                                                                                                                                       |

| **Phase 1:** Proof of Concept        | Manual RC Plane        | Foam-board design, manually controlled RC plane, basic flight stability testing (\~fast-ish speeds).                                                            |
| **Phase 2:** Structured Development  | Organized Architecture | Introduce modular hardware/software, Python-based high-level controls, reusable **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)**, manual takeoff, target speed 100â€“200 mph. |
| **Phase 3:** Optimization & Autonomy | Advanced Control       | Migrate to optimized C/C++ software, custom PCB design, autonomous navigation and takeoff, refine control algorithms, target speed 200 mph.                     |
| **Phase 4:** Fully Autonomous UAV    | Feature Expansion      | High-speed, fully autonomous aircraft with advanced features (mapping, sensor integration).                                                                     |
