# Project-Overview
The Advanced UAC REsearch Organization is a project based club focused on designing, building, and testing a high speed autonomous airplane. The project emphasizes hands-on engineering, collaboration, and applied research in software, hardware, and avionics. This roadmap is iterative and tentative as we learn and research new technologies.
